"""Test processing of unrequested blocks.

We create one NodeConn connection to test_node.

The test:
1. Generate one block, to leave IBD.

2. Mine a new block on the tip, and deliver from node's peer.
   The tip should advance.

3. Mine a block that forks from the genesis block, and deliver to test_node.
   Node should not process this block (just accept the header), because it is
   unrequested and doesn't have more or equal work to the tip.

4. Send another two blocks that builds on the forking block.
   Node should process the second block but be stuck on the shorter chain,
   because it's missing an intermediate block.

4c.Send 288 more blocks on the longer chain.
   Node should process all but the last block (too far ahead in height).
   Send all headers to Node1, and then send the last block in that chain.
   Node1 should accept the block because it's coming from a whitelisted peer.

5. Send a duplicate of the block in #3 to Node0.
   Node0 should not process the block because it is unrequested, and stay on
   the shorter chain.

6. Send Node0 an inv for the height 3 block produced in #4 above.
   Node0 should figure out that Node0 has the missing height 2 block and send a
   getdata.

7. Send Node0 the missing block again.
   Node0 should process and the tip should advance.
